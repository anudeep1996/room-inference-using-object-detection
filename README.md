Preparing Dataset:
In this project, I have used LabelImg open-source annotation tool to check the annotation of the image.
Annotations will be saved as XML files in the PASCAL VOC format, which ImageNet uses. Furthermore, it will be supporting the YOLO format.
We must make sure that annotations and images are in the same directory.
We will be generating the train, test, and validation text files with the help of the images.py file which I have given in my Github repository.
I have divided the data into 80%, 10%, and 10% for the training, testing, and validation sets.
